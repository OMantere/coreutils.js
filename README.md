coreutils.js
============

Basic command line utilities, the Javascript way


This project is an implementation of the [GNU Coreutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)
commands in Javascript, adding some [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
object-oriented features while we were there :-)

This project has got inspiration and ~~stolen~~ borrowed code fragments from
[shelljs](https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs) and
[bashful](https://github.com/substack/bashful) projects.
