Bash built-ins, the Javascript way


This project is an implementation of the Bash built-in commands in Javascript,
and adding some object-oriented features while we were there :-)

This project has got inspiration and ~~stolen~~ borrowed code fragments from
[shelljs](https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs) and
[bashful](https://github.com/substack/bashful) projects.
